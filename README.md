# GitHub Repository for laurenmarietta.github.io

This GitHub repository contains all of the files needed for my personal website: https://laurenmarietta.github.io

### Resources I used to create this website:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - free website hosting through GitHub
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static site generator; very useful for reducing redundancy in source code
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - "an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS."
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - "vector icons and social logos... the web's most popular icon set and toolkit."

### Other useful resources for building personal websites:
- [AstroSites](https://astrosites.github.io/) - a quick tutorial to "help you build and publish your professional website" using HTML5 UP and GitHub
