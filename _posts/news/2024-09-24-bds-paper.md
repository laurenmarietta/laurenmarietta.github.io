This work originated from the 2022 [Algorithmic Reparation Workshop](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/arw/) at the University of Michigan. We define and taxonomize the relationship between algorithmic reparation and algorithmic harm, offering a framework grounded in international human rights law to advise on when algorithmic reparation is an appropriate remedy.
