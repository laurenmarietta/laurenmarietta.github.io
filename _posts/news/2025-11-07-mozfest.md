Bon dia! I'm in Barcelona for my first-ever Mozilla Festival, presenting a talk titled ["Executing a Public Interest Tech Research Agenda: Insights from Social Science"](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/80)  (see my [slides](\pdfs\MozFest2025.pdf)) and reeeeally enjoying the tempranillo.
