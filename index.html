  <div class="description my-4">
    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>As the current Technology Fellow at the <a href="https://www.aclum.org/" target="_blank">ACLU of Massachusetts</a> in Boston, I work on the <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/technology-liberty" target="_blank">Technology for Liberty Project</a> directed by Kade Crockford. My role includes exploring and visualizing government data in order to inform citizens about the effects of legislation and political leadership, as well as supporting ACLUM campaigns that operate at the intersection of technology and civil liberties.</p>

    <p>My personal experience finding a job applying quantitative analytic methods to social problems was far from straightforward -- for those interested in pursuing similar questions, I maintain a <a href="datajustice.html">webpage</a> of organizations, programs, and thinkers who work at the convergence of data/tech/computation and society/justice/ethics.</p>

    <p>Before joining the ACLU, I was a Research and Instrument Analyst for the James Webb Space Telescope mission at <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target="_blank">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. Originally from Hampton, VA, I received my B.S. from Yale in 2017, where I double-majored in astrophysics and African American studies.</p>

    <p>I am immensely passionate about working towards equity and inclusion in all of the spaces that I occupy.</p>

    <p>I invite you to listen to a <a href="https://xoxorosana.com/2018/03/12/astrophysics-and-leadership-s1e5-gtgaj-feat-lauren-chambers/" target="_blank">podcast<a> that I was recently a guest on where I discussed my experiences and goals:</p>

    <p>Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any questions or inquiries!</p>

    <p>P.S. Two of my favorite things are Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future" target="_blank">hmm?</a>) and Google Maps. I actively curate three <a href="maps.html">maps</a> with my recommendations for where to eat and what to do in Boston, Baltimore, and NYC.</p>
